Selection and Transformation:

Outside of iteration, the two most common actions to perform on a collection are selection and transformation.
  Retrieving specific elements from a collection based on certain criteria is selection. Can involve less than the full amount.
  Manipulating ALL the elements in a collection is transformation. Always will affect all elements.
  
Both selection and transformation are built upon the foundations of looping.
  For selection example, a loop that checks if each character in a string is 'g', and assigns those 'g's to a new string.
  For transformation example, a loop that goes through an array of strings and appends an 's' to all of them.

When performing transformations, always keep your mind on whether the original elements are being mutated or not.

Many times, we will move selection and transformation operations to methods as they are highly specific.
