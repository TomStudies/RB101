-Loops are a great way to iterate over many elements in a collection.

-Kernel#loop method accepts a block for a simple loop.
  -break key word ends loop.
  -Counter variables are sometimes necessary (initialized outside) to control loops.
  -break if (conditional) is common.

-Placing break at the END of a loop mimics do/while loop behavior (C++ flashbacks)
  -do/while loops are guaranteed to execute at least once.
-Placing break at the beginning of the loop mimics a while loop.
  -The loop may not execute at all, depending on the state of the break statement.

-next keyword can also control loops by skipping to the next iteration.
  -next if counter.odd? would check if the int counter is odd and skip to the next iteration if so.

-Iterating over hashes is a little more complicated than strings or arrays.
  -We can frequently use the Hash#keys method to create an array of all the keys in the hash, and use that to reference values.
  -You have to iterate over both the keys array and the hash itself in tandem along the loop.
