P - Understand the problem (E implied in these steps)
  -Read the problem, examine the test cases, and clarify any unclear points.
  -Many assumptions need to be clarified: whether to return the same or a different object, whether to consider case, what kinds of inputs a method should accept or reject, etc.
  -Finally, WRITE down inputs and outputs, as well as rules you must follow (basically what you learned from your clarifications and test cases.)
    -Split rules into explicit and implicit ones.
  
D - Data structure
  -Simply determine what structures your data will be transferred through and take during the execution of your...

A- Algorithm
  -Use prior steps to outline the actual code by which you will accomplish the goal (in plain English.)
  -Perhaps start at higher levels of abstraction, then focus in for smaller details and concepts.
  -For those concepts, consider making individual helper methods. Always outline the algorithm before coding.
  -For particularly complex concepts, consider converting to formal pseudocode.

C- Actually code the problem!
  -Fairly straight forward. Check the LS lesson 4 PEDAC section for a very detailed example.

Extra: Testing Frequently
  -Test code early and often while writing.
  -If you wait until you're done with a whole section of code before testing, you'll find bugs when they appear and won't have to trap them later on.

==============
PEDAC VIDEOS
P - Establish a frame of reference for the problem and determine the best path to a solution
  -This is the step where the boundaries of the problem are defined and rules are established
  -Making a list of rules/requirements is an important step to understanding the problem
    -Explicit: Stated in the problem description, Implicit: Seen from test cases, etc
  -Do not rush this step. It is important to clearly understand the problem.

Example:
Given a string, produce a new string with every other word removed.
Input: string
Output: new string
Rule: Remove every other word from input string (explicit)
Even an example this simple may raise questions.
  -What does every other word mean? Start with the first or the second?
  -How do we define a word? separated by spaces?
    -Asking these kinds of questions help us to form the implicit requirements of the problem.
    
E - Examples and test cases
  -Use them to answer questions we have about the implicit requirements of a problem
  -Also confirm our assumptions
  -Help to codify the boundaries of the problem

-If none are provided, you are expected to create them!!

D - Data Structures
  -Thinking about how data should be represented and manipulated is a great first step for determining the best algorithm to use.
  -Help to reason with the data in a more methodical manner
  -Provide methods for interacting with the data at an implementation level

-Think about the data you are provided and the data you need to output, and the operations you will need to use to get there.
  -In determining the data structure, you start to get an understanding of where you will need to go with your algorithm.
  
A - Algorithm (follows naturally from data structures)
  -A logical sequence of steps to accomplish the objective.
  -Think of the algorithm as the way to manipulate the input in order to produce the output.

  -Start at a high level: Avoid code or pseudocode at this point.
  -You can certainly re visit your algorithm during the implementation step to update it or rethink.
  
  -Once a high level algorithm has been created, check the steps and see if any are largely complicated.
  -If so, consider extracting those complicated steps to new problems, and do a miniature PEDAC for each.
    -The nice thing about PEDAC seems to be that it can scale to different sizes of problem.
  -Some substeps are fine, but use good judgement for particularly complex issues.
  
C - Implementing a solution in code
  -Code with intent: Follow your plan and translate the written algorithm to code.
  -First thing: Think of the solution algorithm and how it fits into the language we will use.
    -What methods and features are available to us? Plug these in to additional implementation notes.
  -As the solution is worked, whether to refactor the algorithm depends on a number of factors.
  
-PEDAC is not a completely linear process, you must move around between the steps
  -Or even move back from coding mode to abstract problem solving mode at times
-Be sure not to try to problem solve at the code level.
